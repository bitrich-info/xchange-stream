# XChange-stream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitrich-info/xchange-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitrich-info/xchange-stream)
> **MAINTAINER WANTED:** If anyone would like contribute to this project and become a maintainer, let me know via message. This project would deserve more time than I have.

XChange-stream is a Java library providing a simple and consistent streaming API for interacting with Bitcoin and other crypto currency exchanges via WebSocket protocol.

It is build on top of the [XChange library](https://github.com/timmolter/XChange) providing new interfaces for the exchanges' streaming APIs. Users can subscribe for live updates via reactive streams of [RxJava library](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava).

## Why use it?

- Easy to use - no need to hack WebSocket and other backends.
- Consistent & simple API across all implemented exchanges.
- Extends well-known & active Java library [XChange](http://knowm.org/open-source/xchange/).
- [Reactive streams](http://reactivex.io/) are fun to work with. 
- Modular extensibility.

## Getting started

### Include in your project

Xchange-stream is on Maven Central. You will need `xchange-stream-core` dependency and `xchange-XYZ` where XYZ is supported exchange (eg. `xchange-bitstamp`). Add the following into your `pom.xml`.


#### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>info.bitrich.xchange-stream</groupId>
    <artifactId>xchange-stream-core</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>info.bitrich.xchange-stream</groupId>
    <artifactId>xchange-XYZ</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/info.bitrich.xchange-stream/xchange-stream-core/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22xchange-stream-core%22)

For snapshots version (built from develop branch), add the following repository to your `pom.xml` file.

```xml
<repository>
  <id>sonatype-oss-snapshot</id>
  <snapshots/>
  <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
</repository>
```

#### Versioning 

XChange-stream follows major and minor version from XChange library. So version 4.2.x is based on latest 4.2. release of XChange.


### Example

Use the same library as XChange but instead of `ExchangeFactory` use `StreamingExchangeFactory` that creates `StreamingExchange` instead of `Exchange`. Then you can call `getStreamingMarketDataService` to subscribe to trade data.

```java
StreamingExchange exchange = StreamingExchangeFactory.INSTANCE.createExchange(BitstampStreamingExchange.class.getName());

// Connect to the Exchange WebSocket API. Blocking wait for the connection.
exchange.connect().blockingAwait();

// Subscribe to live trades update.
exchange.getStreamingMarketDataService()
        .getTrades(CurrencyPair.BTC_USD)
        .subscribe(trade -> {
            LOG.info("Incoming trade: {}", trade);
        }, throwable -> {
            LOG.error("Error in subscribing trades.", throwable);
        });

// Subscribe order book data with the reference to the subscription.
Disposable subscription = exchange.getStreamingMarketDataService()
                                  .getOrderBook(CurrencyPair.BTC_USD)
                                  .subscribe(orderBook -> {
                                       // Do something
                                  });

// Unsubscribe from data order book.
subscription.dispose();

// Disconnect from exchange (non-blocking)
exchange.disconnect().subscribe(() -> LOG.info("Disconnected from the Exchange"));
```
